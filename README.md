# Microservice


In this solution, I implemented an e-commerce microservices project with .net core 0.7.

In this project, I have some microservices which implemented e-commerce services such as Identity, Catalog, Basket, Discount, and Ordering microservices with NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis,) and Relational databases (PostgreSQL, SQL Server) with communicating over RabbitMQ Event-Driven Communication and using Ocelot API Gateway.
Also Implemented Centralized Distributed Logging with  Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and SeriLog for Microservices.
I used Grpc Service for inter-service sync communication also I used MassTransit and RabbitMQ for making queues and
async Microservices Communication with RabbitMQ Message-Broker Service.
I Implemented Microservices with DDD, CQRS, and Clean Architecture.
I used Docker Compose establishment with all microservices and databases on Docker.
