# Microservice
in this solution, I implemented an e-commerce microservices project with .net core 7.
in this project, I have some microservices which implemented e-commerce services such as Identity, Catalog, Basket, Discount, and Ordering microservices with NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis,) and Relational databases (PostgreSQL, SQL Server) with communicating over RabbitMQ Event-Driven Communication and using Ocelot API Gateway.
Also Implemented Centralized Distributed Logging with  Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and SeriLog for Microservices
